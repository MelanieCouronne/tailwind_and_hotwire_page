# Tailwind and hotwire page

This page is build with Rails7, Tailwind and Hotwire (+ Stimulus ⚡️)

It's a simple page ☝🏻, with a small database filled with seeds 🌱

Buttons are deliberately not clickable 🚫 but cards are, and display a preview of a story (made with a Hotwire's modal) 👍🏻

```bash
## Features reminder
- Rails 7 new assets pipeline
- Tailwind CSS rather than Bootstrap
- Hotwire
- Stimulus
```
